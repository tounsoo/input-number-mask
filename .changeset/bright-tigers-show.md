"@tounsoo/input-number-mask": patch
---

Refined Storybook documentation with a dedicated Getting Started MDX page and automated API tables using react-docgen-typescript. Removed 'any' types from all stories to improve type safety. Fixed JSDoc comments and removed typos in the useInputNumberMask hook.
